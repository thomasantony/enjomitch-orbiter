[10:43] <Enjo> do you think that Orbiter would allow me to hijack Numpad5 button after checking if angular velocity is less than a given value ?
[10:43] <Enjo> then I'd initiate absolute killrot
[10:43] <Enjo> where given value = 0.0005 m/s eg.
[10:43] <X-Viila> No, but you can do it anyway.
[10:44] <X-Viila> Each timestep, poll if killrot autopilot is active. If it is, check the delta.
[10:44] <X-Viila> If the delta is small enough null the rot and disable killrot.
