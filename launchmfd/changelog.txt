Bugfixes:
Direct ascent: specific off-plane correction works not only in autopilot mode (rep. by Cras)
Direct ascent: improved precision of calculations for synchro ascent
Compass: fixed variables that were displaying 0 (rep. by Jarod)
Stages burnout times are now saved to file, providing correct MECO information for staging vessels, which is then used as input for off-plane correction (saving works only when a pitch program is used)
Time to next launch is saved to a file
Time to node for celestial bodies as targets fixed (rep. by jgrillo2002 and blane)

v. 1.5.0 24-03-2012
Working Direct Ascent! Two modes are available: regular and synchro
Two pitch program modes: time based and altitude based

Autopilot: support for roll program and for upside down flying vessels, like the Space Shuttle
Autopilot: PID values can be adjusted in a running simulation
Bugfix: the AP wouldn't work when the engines were started outside cockpit

v. 1.4.6 15-08-2011
Autopilot: Using PID autopilot instead of Fuzzy logic for better performance – up to 100x time acceleration in space
Autopilot: The PID is both universal for all ships, and configurable via config files for individual vessel classes, when such ships aren't properly controlled by the universal PID.
Doc: Added informations for developers

v. 1.4.5 19-06-2011 
massive code reorganisation and simplification. Many reusable classes have been isolated
formalisation of multiple MFD instances storing technique allowed for eliminating memory leaks and prevents from CTDs upon deleting vessels 
autopilot fix - the ship should not dive right on start now, even if an incorrect PEG readout occurs 
full automation of the direct ascent, although the method itself still needs some work 
added Doxygen documentation 

v. 1.4.0  12-08-2010
- Fuzzy autopilot working for fictional and some realistic craft
- Correct time to launch, also taking nonspherical gravity sources into account
- Direct ascent improvements – uses fuzzy logic and models great circle properly

v. 1.2.8  30-09-2008
- Off-plane correction (by Agentgonzo)
- Data which is displayed on HUD (compass rose, and pitch marker) can be also displayed in the MFD area for vessels derived from VESSEL class.
- Altitude for PEG more ergonomic
- Right mouse click on button which increases a value, decreases this value

v. 1.2.7  04-05-2008
- PEG algorithm integrated. Only for SSTO craft currently (by Agentgonzo)
- HUD display added (Flight Director)  (by Agentgonzo)
- Direct ascent fixes - works for both northern and southern azimuths, and other bugfixes. Still for equatorial launches only.

v. 1.20   20-04-2008 (unreleased)
- New target input box (includes TransX semi-integration)

Minor:
- Inclination change by buttons upgraded.
- Reference Alt removed from user's interface and is fully automatic
- Localisation data moved to a separate file (by Agentgonzo)
- Code restructuring (joint effort), including separation of localisation data

v. 1.07	  20-03-2008
- added an option of targeting celestial bodies. They don't need to orbit your source body
- slightly improved direct ascent algorithm - the turning phase is not that tedious any more and saves about 5% of fuel.

v. 1.05  BETA  24-12-2007
- direct ascent prediction at BETA stage
- fixed some sound bugs and wrong azimuth referencing after launch, and restarting the simulation

v. 0.98.5  10-07-2007
- removed Align MFD and Map MFD dependency by adding Time to Intersection var., and automatically choosing the proper azimuth and referencing. Launch MFD is now self-contained.
- bugfix: turn left/right voice now works fine for an upside-down insertion (the Shuttle)

v. 0.98  14-05-2007
- implemented sound
- visual: Error now changes colour when it drops below 0.10°

v. 0.97  21-03-2007
- Half of Orb. Vel. Time value added
- real-time target's inclination readout – a cure for non-spherical gravity sources
- bugfix: target can be set dependent of latitude, not a set inclination
- visual: tweaked the graphical representation scales so it's less annoying IMHO
- visual: added current heading indicator
- visual: changed “Offset” to “Error” as this seems more correct, and made its value's colour change if it drops below 0.03° so it's easy to spot that you're on course with just a glimpse.

v. 0.96  13-02-2007
- values are now finally saved while switching cockpit modes. My thanks to She'da'Lier for his help and patience
- values are stored and read in and from a scenario file
- She'da'Lier coded a graphical representation of the error
- velocity excess sensor
