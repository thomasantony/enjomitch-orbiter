//                ORBITER AUX LIBRARY: HUDDrawer
//             http://sf.net/projects/enjomitchsorbit
//                  Part of the ORBITER SDK
//
// Allows modules (MFDs or plain modules) to draw on HUD.
// WARNING! This library is a HACK and it may stop working
// in future versions of Orbiter API if the library isn't
// maintained anymore. Note however that it's very easy to do so,
// by updating the VesselHooking class
