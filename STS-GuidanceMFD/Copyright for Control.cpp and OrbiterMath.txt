COPYRIGHT INFORMATION

The source code is yours to freely use, modify, and redistribute, under the following 
conditions:

1) An attribution must be included within your source code/documentation.
2) Any source code that is used in other projects must be provided to subsequent users.  
   The obvious (and preferable, in my opinion) way is to simply provide the source code 
   to your project.  However, I respect the right of programmers to maintain closed source
   if they so desire.  In that case, simply provide a copy of my source files and this 
   Copyright notice with your project.
3) Any "for profit" use must receive prior approval from me. 

Also, though not required, a simple e-mail just to let me know that my code is being used
would be appericiated - it's always nice to know that you've made a useful contribution :-)

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.
