ABOUT
===================

Displays a topographic map in grayscale and RGB.


===================
COMPATIBILITY NOTES
===================

Warning: This MFD is experimental and works only for Orbiter 2016!
Currently, only Jarmonik's DX9 2.1 client (for Orbiter 2016) is supported.


===================
USAGE
===================

- Enable the MFD with Shift+P.
- Switch between RGB and Greayscale modes with Shift+R. You will notice that the greyscale mode is more sensitive.
- If your machine can handle it, for a smoother experience increase the number of simultaneously refreshed lines with Shift+]. Decrease with Shift+[.
- After pressing Shitf+A, the MFD zooms in and out automatically, depending on your altitude. Set zoom to fixed value via Shift+Z and Shift+X,
- Look in the Scenarios/TopographicMapMFD dir for some interesting landmarks.
