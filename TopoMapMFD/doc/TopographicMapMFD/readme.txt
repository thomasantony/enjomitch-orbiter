===================
ABOUT
===================

Displays a topographic map in grayscale and RGB.


===================
COMPATIBILITY NOTES
===================

Warning: This MFD is experimental and works only for Orbiter BETA 2015!
Currently, only Jarmonik's DX9 client (for Orbiter BETA) is supported.


===================
USAGE
===================

- Enable the MFD with Shift+P.
- Switch between RGB and Greayscale modes with Shift+R. You will notice that the greyscale mode is more sensitive.
- If your machine can handle it, for a smoother experience increase the number of simultaneously refreshed lines with Shift+]. Decrease with Shift+[.
- The MFD zooms in and out automatically, depending on your altitude.
- Look in the Scenarios/TopographicMapMFD dir for some interesting landmarks.
