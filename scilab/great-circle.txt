Hi Gavin,

Here's one way to do what you want. Start with the spherical 
coordinates of two points (a,p1,t1) and (a,p2,t2) on the earth. Here, 
a is the radius of the (assumed to be) spherical earth, p1 and p2 are 
co-latitudes, and t1 and t2 are measured from Greenwich all the way 
around, from 0 to 2pi.

Convert these to rectangular coordinates (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) 
using the usual spherical to rectangular conversion formulas.

The points (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2), together with the center of the 
sphere, determine a plane that cuts the sphere in the great circle of 
interest.

Any point r on the line joining (x1,y1,z1) and (x2,y2,z2) can be 
written in the form (I'm thinking in terms of vectors):

   r = {x,y,z} = {x1,y1,z1} + t[{x2,y2,z2} - {x1,y1,z1}]     

What we want, given t in [0,1], is a number g(t), such that the length 
of g(t)*r is a. Solve this equation for g(t). Then g(t)*r is a point 
on the great circle.
